## Hello! My name is Zeke Mackay.

I'm from Hartland, Wisconsin, USA and am currently a first-year student studying Geographic Information Systems and Data Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I'm an avid board game player and traveler, but most importantly a speedcuber.

Speedcubing is a discipline centered about solving the Rubik's Cube (and other such puzzles) as fast as possible. If you're interested in finding out more about why I would spend my time doing this, I'd recommend checking out the documentaries [Why We Cube (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oZY2e25VUw&t=40s&pp=ygULd2h5IHdlIGN1YmU%3D) on Youtube or [The Speed Cubers (2020)](https://www.netflix.com/title/81092143) on Netflix.

I have attended more than 100 [World Cube Association](worldcubeassociation.org) competitions since 2015. Some of my proudest moments during this time include [getting a 17th-in-the-world Rubik's Cube time in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNhYg_uZThc), placing 28th at the 2023 World Championship in South Korea, and being the 8th best 'all-rounder' (skilled at all 17 of the WCA's sanctioned events) in the world for much of 2023.

The World Cube Association has offered me a great outlet for making a difference in the community I grew up in. I started organizing WCA competitions in 2019 and became a WCA Delegate (aka referee) in 2023. More than 2,000 people have competed at competitions I've organized/delegated. In 2022, I joined the WCA Advisory Council and WCA Competition Announcement Team to help the WCA globally. I'm currently the leader of the Announcement Team. 

I also discovered my love of statistics and data science through speedcubing. Using the WCA's [freely-accessible database](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/export/results), I taught myself SQL and Python for data science during high school. Some of my best projects using the WCA's data include a simulator to predict who will win a competition based on previous results and heatmaps of the most active regions of the world for WCA competitions.
