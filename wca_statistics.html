      <p>Here you can find a running list of my endeavors in World Cube Association (WCA) statistics. My goal is to backfill as many of my previous statistics as possible.
      Most of these queries are for the Facebook group <a href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/439995439706174>WCA Statistics</a>.
      Most data is from either the WCA <a href='https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/export/results'>TSV Results export</a> or <a href='https://statistics.worldcubeassociation.org/database-query'>SQL Developer Export</a>.

      <h1>2024-12-16 - Heatmap of WCA ID years and when they last competed</h1>
      <p>
        Requested by Manu Singhal <br>
        This heatmap shows the number of people for which their first competition was in [row] year and their latest competition was in [column] year. Unfortunately the results are uninteresting due to how many people stop competing their first year. Perhaps this is a query I'll come back to in search of a better visualization.

    <h1>2024-12-15 - Countries that held WCA competitions on the greatest number of dates in 2024.</h1>
        <p>
            This is part of a larger project related to the competition frequency heatmaps I posted a few months ago. 
            My end goal with those is to exclude competitions that happened on the same day.
            No surprises here though; US, Poland, Sweden, and Colombia are the kings of spamming competitions this year.
