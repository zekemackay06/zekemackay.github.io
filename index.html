<h2 id="hello-my-name-is-zeke-mackay-">Hello! My name is Zeke Mackay.</h2>
<p>I&#39;m from Hartland, Wisconsin, USA and am currently a first-year student studying Geographic Information Systems and Data Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I&#39;m an avid board game player and traveler, but most importantly a speedcuber.</p>
<p>Speedcubing is a discipline centered about solving the Rubik&#39;s Cube (and other such puzzles) as fast as possible. If you&#39;re interested in finding out more about why I would spend my time doing this, I&#39;d recommend checking out the documentaries <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oZY2e25VUw&amp;t=40s&amp;pp=ygULd2h5IHdlIGN1YmU%3D">Why We Cube (2018)</a> on Youtube or <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81092143">The Speed Cubers (2020)</a> on Netflix.</p>
<p>I have attended more than 100 <a href="worldcubeassociation.org">World Cube Association</a> competitions since 2015. Some of my proudest moments during this time include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNhYg_uZThc">getting a 17th-in-the-world Rubik&#39;s Cube time in 2022</a>, placing 28th at the 2023 World Championship in South Korea, and being the 8th best &#39;all-rounder&#39; (skilled at all 17 of the WCA&#39;s sanctioned events) in the world for much of 2023.</p>
<p>The World Cube Association has offered me a great outlet for making a difference in the community I grew up in. I started organizing WCA competitions in 2019 and became a WCA Delegate (aka referee) in 2023. More than 2,000 people have competed at competitions I&#39;ve organized/delegated. In 2022, I joined the WCA Advisory Council and WCA Competition Announcement Team to help the WCA globally. I&#39;m currently the leader of the Announcement Team. </p>
<p>I also discovered my love of statistics and data science through speedcubing. Using the WCA&#39;s <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/export/results">freely-accessible database</a>, I taught myself SQL and Python for data science during high school. Some of my best projects using the WCA&#39;s data include a simulator to predict who will win a competition based on previous results and heatmaps of the most active regions of the world for WCA competitions.</p>
